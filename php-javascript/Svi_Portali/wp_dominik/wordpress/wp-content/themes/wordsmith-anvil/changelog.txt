Version 1.5.2
-------------
-added editor-style.css back to theme
-removed attribute value from input element on sidebar form
-replaced esc_textarea in sanitize function with filter_var for ad boxes, because esc_textarea does not allow javascript and esc_js only applies to inline javascript and none of the other built in wp functions work for sanitizing javascript. So, I used a php function for that purpose.
