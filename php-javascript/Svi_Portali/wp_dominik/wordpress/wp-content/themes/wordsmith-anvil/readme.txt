( Question - One ): How do I change the header image?

(answer): From the "Appearance" Menu on the left side of your admin screen, select the Header option. Then select one of the available images, or upload your own header image. Your header image will need to be the same size as indicated on the Header Menu Option Page. You can also select to remove the header image and leave the area a solid color.


( Question - Two ): How do I change the background image?

(answer): From the "Appearance" Menu on the left side of your admin screen, select the Background option.You have the option to upload your own background image. You will have options including tiling the image, etc. You can also select to remove the background image and return to the default background image.


( Question - Three ): How do I implement the menus?

(answer): From the "Appearance" Menu on the left side of your admin screen, select the Menus option. On the Menu Options Page you will need to add one or both navigation menus that come with this theme. There is a side navigation menu, which has an animated hover effect. This menu can accommodate nested menus; however, it was designed primarily for top level (non-nested) page navigation only. This menu will work regardless whether or not you setup the custom menu. However, you have more control over what is displayed in the menu, if you create a custom menu. You can call your menu anything you want. Once you have created a menu you will see there are two menu options displayed. (see the screenshot).  The same directions apply for the top menu. (see the screenshot). The top navigation menu is not animated. However, it has been designed to accommodate nested navigation (if you setup the custom menu). In fact, it includes the Superfish jQuery code to facilitate the hover actions. This functionality is coded into this theme. It does not require that you download the Superfish Widget Plugin or any other plugin in order for the menu to work correctly. With Wordpress 3+ you have numerous options for your menus. For example, you can add pages, categories or internal and external links or a mixture of all the above to the same menu. If it makes sense for your navigation you could even have a category menu item nested under a static page. The names for the two custom menus in this theme are: "Left Aside Animated Menu" (the primary menu) and "Top Nested Menu" (the secondary menu).


( Question - Four ): Are there any widgetized areas?

(answer): The answer is yes! There are actually five widgetized areas. The left sidebar can display widgets; and above the footer there are four widgetized areas. (see the screenshot) From the "Appearance" Menu on the left side of your admin screen, select the Widgets option. On the Widgets Options Page you can drag available widgets to the five different widgetized areas. Dependant upon which additional plugins you decide to install, there may be other widget options listed on the Widgets Options Page. The Admin Options Panel also includes a couple of options for adding content to the sidebar and to the above footer area. Please note that if you try to add content or a widget that is wider than the widgetized area, it will not display correctly and will throw off the other page elements. For example, if the width of your widget area is 300px and you try to place an ad that is 768px wide in that area, it will not fit. 


( Question - Five ): What about custom options &hellip; are there any?

(answer): Yes and Yes are the answers! First, there are custom options and second, there is a custom options admin panel page for this theme. From the "Appearance" Menu on the left side of your admin screen, select "Anvil Theme Options". In fact, when you first activate the theme you will be automatically redirected to the custom options admin page. The free version of this theme contains less options than the paid version. However, there are custom options available for both. Take a look below. The free version contains options for the following sections: 

	Custom Logo
	Tagline
	Subscribe Links
	Sidebar aka Aside
	Pages
	Footer
	Ads and Analytics

( Question - Six ): How do I add my own logo?

(answer): Adding your own logo is very easy. Once you are at the "Anvil Theme Options" Page you simply need to click on the green Plus (+) Sign next to the Section titled "Custom Logo."  You will see this section expand and the three parts to this section will be visible. First, you need to place a check in the box that enables this option. Second, add the name of your logo file. The directory where you need to upload your file will be displayed for you in this section (see screenshot). There is also an option for you to place content in your alt tag. The alt tag will display when someone hovers over your logo image. The content you added is the text that will be displayed. After you have uploaded your logo image and made changes to the Custom Logo section, click the "Save All Changes" button below the admin panel. You will see a notice above the panel letting you know when your changes have been saved. You can then click on the red Minus (-) Sign to collapse this section. 


( Question - Seven ): Is there a way to enable or disable the tagline?

(answer): The answer is yes! This theme will display your tagline on the left side of the page in the footer area, if you have it enabled. You can change the content of your tagline from the "General" subsection of the "Settings Menu" on the left side of your admin page. The option to enable or disable the tagline is located in the Anvil Theme Options admin panel, under the section appropriately titled "Tagline."  You open, close and access it in the same manner as the "Custom Logo Option" described above. To enable the tagline simply check the box next to "Display Tagline." Leave the box unchecked if you do not want to display the tagline. Don't forget to save your change.


( Question - Eight ): Is the theme RSS &amp; Social Network Enabled?

(answer): Once again, the answer is Yes!  Once enabled the RSS icon and selected Social Network icons are displayed below the title of your website, in the header area, on the right side of the page. You access the Anvil Theme Options admin panel section entitled "Subscribe Links" to enable and setup these options.  You can either disable all of these options, or enable only the RSS feed icon without displaying any social network icons. Clicking on any of the displayed icons will take the visitor to your respective social network page, or RSS feed. In addition to an RSS feed, the social networks you can enable include: 


	Facebook
	Twitter
	Flickr
	YouTube
	Foursquare


If you choose to select the option to enable the RSS feed and social networks you then need to select each social network you want to enable. Then add your username in the respective input boxes for Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and Foursquare. For Facebook you do not add a username. Instead you add the link to your profile page. Don't forget the <code>http://</code>.


( Question - Nine ): What Sidebar/Aside Options are there?

(answer): The sidebar includes a searchform at the top and a navigation menu immediately below it. Below the navigation menu your latest post will be displayed with the title, mini thumbnail image, date of the post, short summary and link to the actual post. Note: this is the latest post, not the latest sticky post. For modern browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Firefox, you will notice the thumbnail image rotates a few degrees when you hover over it. In addition to the sidebar/aside elements already mentioned, there are a couple more options for this theme; as shown below: 

	Feedburner Newsletter

	Enable Your Newsletter
	A title for your newsletter
	Your Feedburner Feed Name


	Any Feedburner Feed

	Enable the Feedburner Feed (will display two most recent feed posts)
	Name you want to display for this Feed
	The <code>url</code> of the Feedburner Feed


The difference in these two options is that the first option gives your visitors a convenient form to sign up for your Feedburner feed; whereas, the second option allows you to display the two most recent post summaries from any Feedburner feed you want to display. It could be one of your own feeds, or it might be industry-related feeds or other value-added feeds you would like to provide for visitors to your site. The date of each of these posts are also displayed and the title is click-able. 



( Question - Ten ): Does this theme have a slider?

(answer): Yes and No! The paid version of this theme includes an FX Effects Slider, with some advanced options available from the Slider sections of the Anvil Theme Options Admin Panel. However, the free version does not include this slider. More information will be added here about the slider soon. :)


( Question - Eleven ): Whats the deal with the coupon on the front page?

(answer): There are some custom page templates with this theme, including a front page template and a blog main page template. Using custom fields and the the Pages section of the Anvil Theme Options Admin Panel you can display a coupon on either or both of those pages. (see screenshot) However, if you want to use this section to display some other message rather than a coupon, you can use it for that purpose as well.


( Question - Twelve ): What about footer links and credits?

(answer): The Anvil Theme Options Admin Panel contains a section titled "Footer" which allows you to enable or disable Wordpress credit links. Also, the footer area is a great place to add links for a privacy page, terms of service (TOS), contacts, sitemap, careers page, or other similar types of links. These footer links are not generally displayed the same as your navigation menus. This theme allows you to enable or disable these types of links in the footer. You can add up to six links for the footer and give each link a display name. The other footer option allows you to add your company name or organization, entity or personal name; which will be displayed with the copyright notice in the footer, too. 


( Question - Thirteen ): Can I add analytics code or ads?

(answer): Starting with version 1.6.0 the answer is No and No! Up through version 1.5.3 you were able to add analytics code in the header or in the footer. Also, you could insert ad code in multiple locations. From the Anvil Theme Options Admin Panel open the Ads and Analytics Section. You would have seen the following options available: 


	Header Asynchronous Analytics/Stats Code
	Footer Stats Code
	Ad Areas Above Content on Posts and Pages
	Ad Areas Below Content on Posts and Pages
	Ad Area in the Sidebar

If you are using Google's new Asynchronous Analytics code you will want to place it in the header. That is what this option was for. Alternately, if you are using some other code that needs to be placed in the header instead of the Google code, you would have used this box. If you are using the regular analytics tracking code that is generally placed at the end of the body of the page, use the Footer Stats Code box. If you are using Google AdSense or some other Ad Network, you could have placed ads in three different locations. These were some simple options for adding AsSense or other Ad Network advertising to your site. In the event you need a more complex solution, there are a number of plugins available that may accommodate your needs. This is a basic version of Wordsmith-Anvil. All of these options will be available along with several more options when the Premium version of this theme is released. Until then, you will need to manually ad your analytics code and/or use plugins for analytics and ad code.


( Question - Fourteen ): What pages and templates come with this theme?

(answer): In addition to the default template, there are seven other template pages, as well as, an author page and a custom 404 error page that provides a helpful message for your visitor and also sends you an email whenever some visitor clicks on a page with a broken link. This page feature helps you to make sure you do not have bad links to images, scripts, or removed pages or posts so that you can be assured your visitors enjoy a good user experience on your site. The page templates that come with this theme include: 


	Blog Home Page
	Categories Page
	Product Page
	Site Front Page
	Wide Page with No Sidebar
	
( Question - Fifteen ): Does this theme support sticky posts?

(answer): Yes! In addition to support for sticky posts by the basic index page, the custom Front Page and Blog Main Page also support sticky posts. If you have saved your post as a sticky post it will display at the beginning of the posts and you will know if it is a sticky post because on the meta bar to the right of the date and author's name you will see the word "sticky". To the right of the sticky notification are Page Views [if enabled] and the number of comments for the post [or, if there are no posts, a message letting you know that comments are requested] (see the screenshot)


( Question - Sixteen ): Does this theme support post thumbnails?

(answer): Yes! For those unfamiliar with what this question refers to, it simply means that you do not have to resize all of your page and post thumbnails to a uniform size, manually upload them and then use a custom field to insert a thumbnail into your posts and pages. All you do is click the Featured Image link on the right sidebar of your Edit Post or Edit Page Admin Pages (see screenshot). A popup will allow you to upload larger images that will be automatically uniformly resized for you; so all you need to do after the image has been crunched for you, is add the alt text and caption you would like to display and click "Use as Featured Image" ... and then when you update your page or post, you can view that page or post and see your thumbnail is already resized and included for you.


( Question - Seventeen ): What are the custom fields used in this theme?
(answer): There are over thirty different custom fields that can be used with the different template pages for this theme. Below are the custom fields that can be used on their respective template pages: 

	Product Page
	
	product_large
	price
	product_code

	bq-line-cite
	front-page-quote-image
	product_description
	product_regular
	the-coupon
	view_btn_text
	featured_products_title


( Question - Eightteen ): How do you setup the Site Front Page Template?

(answer): If you choose to use it, there are three parts to setting up the Site Front Page Template. First, you add a page named Home, or something similarly appropriate. Then you select the "Site Front Page" Template (see screenshot) for this page. You make all of the edits to the content on this page using custom fields (see also the screenshot). The intro text, the three lines of the blockquote, the cite and the image (where you now see two anvils) are all changed with custom fields. Second, with regard to the two featured categories, this part requires that you setup your store page (the parent category page), sub-category pages and some product pages. The reason is because you are going to be displaying two products, from two featured categories. You will also need to make two quick edits to the template itself. At line 33 you need to change the post_parent=35 to the appropriate page number ID for the first category page you want to feature products from. Likewise on line 40 for the second product category you need to change "37" to whatever the post ID is for the second sub-category page you want to feature products from.The third part is to go to the Settings Menu on the left side of your Admin Page and select the third option&mdash;Reading. At the top of that option page, select a static page for your front page and select the page you just created from the dropdown menu. Do not select any page for the blog page. Save your change and on to the next step in setting up your site. 


( Question - Nineteen ): How do you setup the Blog Home Page Template?

(answer): This one is easier to setup than the Front Page. Create a new page for your blog and give your blog a name ... probably something other than "Blog" ... Whatever you call it, you simply select the Blog Home Page from the Template dropdown menu of your Page Attributes; and then update your page. If you do want to display a coupon at the bottom of your main blog page you can add one custom field to this page and enter the text you want displayed in the custom field value input box. Now that you have saved your page, if you look at the address bar on the top of your page you will see part of an address like this: "wp-admin/post.php?post=" The number immediately after this is the page ID for this page. Now, all you need to do is go to line 55 of your Blog Home Page Template and enter the ID number for the new page you created and save that template page.  That's it. This page is completed. 


( Question - Twenty ): How do you setup a Store or Parent Category Page?

(answer): Setting up the Store or Parent Category Page is a fairly quick process. However, it is a two part process. The first step is to add a new page and give it whatever name you want to call your store. For Page Attributes leave it as a Parent page and select the Categories Page from the Template dropdown options. Then click Update. That completes the first step. You will need to come back later to finish setting up the page ... after you have added your sub-category pages (i.e., the individual category pages for your products). Once you have set up your categories you will come back and add one custom field to this page. The custom field name is "categories" and the value will be the names of each of your categories and their respective page ID numbers (page name and page ID separated by the pipe symbol '|'); with each page name | page ID pair separated by a comma. No trailing comma is placed at the end. For example, lets say you have three categories. The page name for your first category is Self Help and the corresponding page ID is 10. For the second the name is Astrology and ID is 14. Finally, the name for your third category is Programming and the ID is 17. Here is how the value would look <code>Self Help|10,Astrology|14,Programming|17</code> ... Once you have added that custom field you will update the page again ... and it is setup and complete ... until you add more categories of products. Of course, you would come back and append the page name and page ID pairs for each new page you setup.


( Question - Twentyone ): How do you setup a Product Category Page?

(answer): Setting up the Product Category Page is also a fairly quick process. However, it is a two part process. The first step is to add a new page and give it whatever name you want to call your product category. For Page Attributes select your Store / Parent Category Page as the Parent page and select the Categories Page from the Template dropdown options. Then click Update. That completes the first step. The second step is very easy, too. Now you will add one custom field to this page. The custom field name is "categories" and the value will be the name of your page and the page ID number (page name and page ID separated by the pipe symbol '|'). For example, lets say the page name for this category page is Self Help and the corresponding page ID is 10. Here is how the value would look <code>Self Help|10</code> ... How do you determine the page ID you ask? Take a look at the screenshot for the answer. :)


( Question - Twentytwo ): How do you setup a Product Page?

(answer): Setting up the Product Category Page is the most difficult and time consuming of all pages to setup. However, after you setup the first one, the others will be easier. The first step is to add a new page and give it whatever name you want to call your product. For Page Attributes select the appropriate Product Category Page as the Parent page and select the Product Page from the Template dropdown options. Then click Update. That completes the first step. The second step is slightly more complex. Now you will add several custom fields to this page. The custom field names for this page are those mentioned in <a href="#seventeenprods-Question 17</a> above. You will need to insert appropriate values for each of the custom field names you use. (see the screenshot)The custom fields that have been setup with this theme should work well for an author or someone marketing books or similar items. You can go into the template and change the custom fields, or add more custom fields as needed, if you are comfortable with some basic PHP. On the other hand, if you would like the theme customized for your products, or needs, please let us know.


( Question - Twentythree ): Is this theme setup to display breadcrumbs?

(answer): Yes! This theme has been setup so breadcrumbs will display on the Products Pages, Product Category Pages and Post Pages. Initially, I set up breadcrumbs on the Search and Archive Pages; however, it seemed more of a distraction than a help for those pages. The breadcrumbs plugin is recommended if you are using the Store, Category and Product Pages. All you need to do is install that F-R-E-E plugin from the Wordpress.org plugin extensions and make sure it is activated and setup. The plug-in is Breadcrumb NavXT. 


( Question - Twentyfour ): Is this theme setup to display pagination?

(answer): Yes! This theme is setup to display attractive pagination. From the Settings -> "Reading" Options Admin Page you can select the number of posts you want to display per page. The default is 10. So, if you only want to display 5 posts per page, this is where you would change that setting. That is all there is to it. Attractive Pagination is all set up. However, if you like using Lester Chan's WP Navi, this theme is setup to work well with that plug-in. In the event you install that plugin and decide to use it, make sure it is activated and make any changes to the configuration that you want ... and you are ready to go.


( Question - Twentyfive ): Is this theme setup to display the number of page views?

(answer): Yes!  This theme is setup to display the number of page or post views. If you download the plugin and activate it, you will see the post views and/or page views on the meta bar of pages and posts. The number of views will display to the left of the number of comments and to the right of the date, author link and sticky notice. The plugin this is setup to work with is Lester Chan's WP PostViews. He has quit supporting his plug-ins. However, they still work. I did notice that this plugin will generate an error, if you have your Wordpress installation setup in Debug mode. However, it is unlikely you would be running your live site with DeBug mode turned on [In fact, you have to manually turn on Debugging in one of the core Wordpress files, if you want to debug your site. It is not turned on by default.] That being said, this plug-in should work fine the way it is. 


( Question - Twentysix ): Does this theme have a custom author page?

(answer): Yes! This theme has a custom Author Page template. Each author who contributes on your site should have an avatar and add a short bio from the Users-> "Your Profile" Admin Page. The reason why their bio should be added is because whenever any page or post they publish is displayed, their author link will be displayed in the meta bar for that page. A visitor can click on that link and be taken to a page that will display the author's bio and avatar; along with summaries of all of the posts they have published on your site. (see the screenshot) 


( Question - Twentyseven ): Why does my top menu display incorrectly in IE?

(answer): You are using an older outdated version. Update to a newer version. The best version to update to is Version 2.1.


( Question - Twentyeight ): How do I display full posts on the Front Page instead of excerpt-length custom posts with custom More links?

(answer): The interim answer for version 1.6.8-beta has been revised. The current correct answer is that as of Version 2.1 Full Posts are the default option. Unless you select another option from the Theme Options Page, then you will be displaying full posts on the front page, home page and sidebar (if you select the option to display the latest post in the sidebar).


( Question - Twentynine ): How do I disable the custom More links in excerpts??

(answer): The interim answer for version 1.6.8-beta has been revised. The current correct answer is that as of Version 2.1 Custom More Links are not the default option. Now, if you want to use Custom More Links you can enable that option from the Page & Post Display Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. The default more link is now: [Read the full story ...]


( Question - Thirty ): Can I disable the display of the Title at the top of the Page? If so, how do I do it?

(answer): The answer is YES! Enable the "Do NOT Display Title" option, found in the "Title" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box.


( Question - ThirtyOne ): I have a Google+ Social Network Account. Can I add it to the Social Network Links in the Subscribe &amp; Follow area?

(answer): The answer is YES! Enable the "Enable Google+" option, found in the "Subscribe Links" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Then add your Google+ Account Number in the "Google+ Account Number" box. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box.


( Question - ThirtyTwo ): Can I disable the Search Bar at the top of the sidebar. If so, how do I do it? 

(answer): The answer is YES! Select the box "Disable Search Bar at top of Sidebar" option, found in the "Sidebar/Aside" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box.


( Question - ThirtyThree ): Can I disable the Latest Post in the Sidebar? If so, how do I do it?

(answer): The answer is YES! Select the box "Disable Latest Post in Sidebar" option, found in the "Sidebar/Aside" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box.


( Question - ThirtyFour ): Okay ... so this theme has Custom Formatted Short Posts? What are they &amp; How do I use them?

(answer): Custom Formatted Short Posts are shorter versions of the Post, like Excerpts. However, the difference is that no html is allowed in an excerpt. For example, words that are bolded or italicized will look the same in an excerpt as all the other words. No other html tags will work either. In the Custom Formatted Short Posts html tags do work. If you do not want to display the full posts on your front page, home page or in the latest post on the sidebar (if you did not disable that display option) this is another option. Enable the "Enable Formatted Short Posts (Like Excerpts)" option, found in the "Page &amp; Post Display Options" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box.


( Question - ThirtyFive ): If I use Custom Formatted Short Posts how many words are displayed; and can I change it to a different number?

(answer): The default length for Custom Formatted Short Posts is 65 words. YES ... You can change that to display less words, or more words.  Enter the number (as an integer ... like 40,57,62,75,83 etc) in the input box for the "How many words do you want to display on Formatted Short Posts?" option, found in the "Page &amp; Post Display Options" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. The CAVEAT are ... Do not you use these tags <!--more-->, <!--nextpage--> in the first XX number of words in your post [where XX is equal to the number of words you select in the option below]. Also, if you use any of the following tags <a href="">, <p>, <div>, <table>, <caption>, <ul>, <li> etc within those XX number of words, then you need to make sure their corresponding closing tags (ie ... </a>, </p>, </div>, </table>, </caption>, </ul>, </li> etc ) are also used, or you will break the display of the page. It's a pretty sick, slick, or totally awesome option. 


( Question - ThirtySix ): What if I just want to disply my posts with simple excerpts, can I do that?

(answer): Absolutely YES! Enable the "Display Excerpts (on Blog &amp; Front Page)" option, found in the "Page &amp; Post Display Options" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. Is that simple or what? BTW, there is a CAVEAT: You cannot select both options ... "Show Excerpts" and "Formatted Short Posts". You must choose one or the other, or neither. To Recap: Choosing neither will result in the display of full posts on the front page. Also  if you did not disable the Sidebar Latest Post option, it will display excerpts on all pages except the front page and/or the home page. On those pages it will display full posts, excerpts or Custom Formatted Short Posts, depending on which options you have selected.


( Question - ThirtySeven ): If I choose to display Excerpts am I stuck with 55 words, or can I change the number of words in the Excerpt?  

(answer): The answers are NO and YES ... No you are not stuck with 55 words; and YES you can change it to whatever number of words you want to display. You can change that to display less words, or more words. The default number of words to display in Excerpts on this theme are 55 words. Enter the number (as an integer ... like 40,57,62,75,83 etc) in the input box for the "How many words do you want to display on front page EXCERPTS?" option, found in the "Page &amp; Post Display Options" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. As an FYI, Additionally, if you decide to use the Front Page Template that comes with this theme, it displays two sticky post excerpts at the bottom of the page. Even if you do not use excerpts on your blog, you can use this option to select the number of words you want to display in the "Front Page Template" excerpts, too. ALSO, because "The Latest Post" Option in the sidebar will display excerpts on all pages that are not the Front Page and/or the Home Page, you can use this option to determine how many words will be displayed in the sidebar excerpts, too. 


( Question - ThirtyEight ): The first letter of all paragraphs is about twice the size of the other letters. Can I make it the same size?

(answer): Yes you can. In fact, in all versions of this theme you could have made the first letter the same size as the other letters of a paragraph. However, prior to Version 2.1 it would have required that you went into the stylesheet and edited it; which, not everyone is capable of doing. So, now you no longer need to know how to edit code. Simply check the box for the "Disable Large First Letter" option, found in the "Page &amp; Post Display Options" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. 


( Question - ThirtyNine ): I would like to display the WordPress Credits in the footer. How do I do that?

(answer): That is a Great Question. Countless hours have gone into the development of WordPress; with over 50 million installations worldwide. It is an open source platform and WordPress.org would greatly appreciate if you gave them a credit link in your footer. To do so, Enable the "Enable WordPress credits" option, found in the "Footer" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. 


( Question - Forty ): This is an awesome theme. Is it possible to display a Developer's Credit in the footer?

(answer): That is an absolutely GREAT IDEA! The answer is an emphatic YES! Many, many hours went into development. So we appreciate you giving credit where credit is due. Simply Enable the "Enable Developer credit" option, found in the "Footer" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. If you want to show even more support, in addition to displaying a Developer Credit in the footer you could become one of the small group of exceedingly brilliant individuals who have given donations in support of this theme. FYI, so far, no donations have been turned down. 


( Question - FortyOne ): I would like to make a donation but can't afford to right now. Is there a hidden developer link that I can enable to show support?

(answer): Thanks for wanting to support this theme and developer. The majority of users that download a theme do not want to give the developer credit for the work they put into a theme or plugin. There are a myriad of reasons why. Monetary support is of course, greatly appreciated. However, not everyone is able, or cares about the many, many hours that went into developing a theme. There is another way that everyone who downloads this theme can support it ... without having to let anyone else in on the secret that you didn't actually design this theme yourself; and additionally, without it costing you even ONE PENNY. If you do not want to publicly give the developer any credit and do not desire or have the ability to donate to the developer, then you can have the best of all worlds and still help the developer by enabling the "Enable Hiding the Developer Link" option, found in the "Footer" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. Whichever form of support you can provide is greatly appreciated. 


( Question - FortyTwo ): I have had problems with the Visual Editor on some themes. Does this theme use any custom styling for the Visual Editor?  

(answer): In earlier versions of this theme a few users (FWIW, all were using Macs and the Visual Editor) experienced some problems when pasting content into the Visual Editor. The TinyMCE Visual Editor doesn't always handle pasted content well. However, I believe there was also another issue. This theme uses some custom fonts; and those custom fonts were added to the styling of the Visual Editor stylesheet. Some people that use a Visual Editor like it to resemble the way the content will look when published. To some extent the default Visual Editor stylesheet for this theme allows the user to see the post similarly to how it will look when published. If you like to use the Visual Editor, but want the display to be a little more generic looking, or if you experience issues with data not saving, or other Visual Editor oddities, then you may benefit from the optional Visual Editor stylesheet that accompanies this theme. I have never seen another theme on the WordPress Repository that offers a Visual Editor styelsheet option. So, this may be a first. Nonetheless, in an effort to provide a better Visual Editor experience you are welcome to give this option a try. Enable the "Try this option if the Visual Editor Has Display Issues" option, found in the "Visual Editor Option" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. If you want to change back, simple uncheck the option and save your change. You will go back to the default Visual Editor Styling. BTW, if you do not like using a Visual Editor, regardless of the styling you can also turn it off from the Personal Options in Your Profile, under the Users Menu on the Admin Screen.


( Question - FortyThree ): Does this theme have a Subscribe to Comments Option; and if so, how do I enable it?

(answer): YES it does. What's nice is that you do not have to do anything to make it work. You can even install the plugin: "Subscribe to Comments Reloaded" to add more functionality and Comment Subscription Management options. 


( Question - FortyFour ): This theme has a metabar that displays the date of the post and who the author is. Can I disable it and if so, how do I disable display of that?

(answer): The answer is YES! Place a check in the box entitled "Disable Display of PostMeta Information" option, found in the "Page &amp; Post Display Options" Options section on the Theme Options Page. Click the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Theme Options Box. 


( Question - FortyFive ): Will this theme conflict with plugins like: AddThis Social Bookmarking Widget; Fast Secure Contact Form; and Subscribe to Comments Reloaded? 

(answer): Great Question. In fact, this theme has been tested with all of those plugins. If you are looking for a theme that is compatible with those plugins, this one is.
